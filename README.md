Different coding prompts

- Two-Sum-Solver: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. <br />
      - Time complexity O(n^2): Quadratic growth/ Polynomial Time <br />
            - First loop runs N times <br />
            - Second loop runs N times <br />
            - N * N = N^2 => O(N^2) <br />

- String-Reversing: User inputs a string and in return prints out the backwards <br />
      - Time Complexity O(n): Linear time <br />
            - If you double the size of the input, the time it takes also doubles. <br />
            - If you have n elements, the algorithm will take n steps to complete. <br />
